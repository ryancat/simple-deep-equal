# Simple deep equal
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ryancat/simple-deep-equal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ryancat/simple-deep-equal)

## In a nutshell
Simple deep equal is a very simple deep equal implementation for nodejs and browser environment written in javascript. It uses recursive functions for nested arrays and objects to test equality. I want to keep this super simple with ok performance.

## Todo
I may add more code to handle more complicated cases like circular references, super large objects/array, etc.
