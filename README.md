# Simple deep equal
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ryancat/simple-deep-equal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ryancat/simple-deep-equal)

Simple deep equal is a very simple deep equal implementation for nodejs and browser environment written in javascript. It uses recursive functions for nested arrays and objects to test equality. I want to keep this super simple with ok performance.

## Test cases
- Primitive types
- NaN
- Array
- Object
- Circular references

## Todo
- Function
- Class inheritance (prototype chain)
